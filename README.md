## Overview

MatchPlant is an open-source pipeline designed for the automated detection of individual objects using UAV-derived imagery. The pipeline combines interactive tools for preparing UAV imagery with automated deep-learning methods and data extraction capabilities. For the case study, it is used for individual maize detection. By leveraging the Faster R-CNN object detection model trained on high-resolution, undistorted UAV images. MatchPlant also provides utilization modules to incorporate the detected bounding boxes and extract digital plant traits from an orthomosaic.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Flexible framework adaptable to various agricultural applications
- **Automated Object Detection**: Uses Faster R-CNN for reliable individual plant detection
- **High-Precision Processing**: Trains on high-resolution, undistorted UAV images to avoid orthomosaic artifacts
- **Geospatial Transformation**: Accurately projects detected plant coordinates onto orthomosaic
- **User-Friendly Tools**: User-friendly GUI tools for data preparation and manual annotation
- **Data Extraction & Analysis**: Enables spatial analysis and phenotypic trait extraction

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following modules, each containing specific components of the pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and optimize UAV imagery
   - GPS data embedding tool
   - GCP file creation tool
   - Orthomosaic generation using OpenDroneMap

2. **Data Preparation**: Label and organize training, validation, and testing data
   - Optimal UAV image dataset creation tool
   - Interactive labeling tool
   - Data tiling and splitting tool

3. **Model Development**: Train and test detection models, including the transfer learning model
   - Faster R-CNN training and validation
   - Model testing
   - Transfer learning utility

4. **Utilization**: Project location and create a layer to extract object features
   - Detection projection tool
