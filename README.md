## Overview

MatchPlant is an open-source pipeline designed for automated detection of individual objects using UAV-derived imagery. The pipeline combines interactive tools for UAV imagery preparation with automated deep learning methods and data extraction capabilities. In this case, the pipeline is used for individual maize detection, by leveraging the Faster R-CNN object detection model trained on high-resolution undistorted UAV images, MatchPlant effectively removes common artifacts from the training dataset while ensuring accurate spatial analysis and trait extraction.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Flexible framework adaptable to various agricultural applications
- **Automated Object Detection**: Uses Faster R-CNN for reliable individual plant detection
- **High-Precision Processing**: Trains on high-resolution undistorted UAV images to avoid orthophoto artifacts
- **Geospatial Transformation**: Accurately projects detected plant coordinates onto orthophotos
- **User-Friendly Tools**: User-friendly GUI tools for data preparation and manual annotation
- **Data Extraction & Analysis**: Enables spatial analysis and phenotypic trait extraction

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following branches, each containing specific components of the pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and optimize UAV imagery
   - GPS data embedding tool
   - GCP file creation tool
   - Orthophoto generation using OpenDroneMap

2. **Data Preparation**: Label and organize training, validation, and testing data
   - Optimal UAV image dataset creation tool
   - Interactive labeling tool
   - Data tiling and splitting tool

3. **Model Development**: Train and test detection models, including the transfer learning model
   - Faster R-CNN training and validation
   - Model testing
   - Transfer learning utility

4. **Utilization**: Project location and creat a layer to getobject features
   - Detection projection tool
   - Shapefile generation tool

Each branch contains its own detailed README with specific installation instructions and usage guidelines.
